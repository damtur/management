# My leadership readme/operating manual
## My Leadership Philosophy
I'm here to help you. Help you grow, develop and be more successful in your career. You can consider me to be your
personal coach regarding your career. We achieve it together and we will work hard together to make it happen.

I value honesty and deep, true relationship above everything else. You can expect me to be open and sensible. You can
also expect me to give you blunt and respectful feedback.

Learning and growth is a lifelong endeavor of mine. I'm open for feedback and if you have any piece of advice please let
me know when you think of it.

Remember it's not me and you. It's us and we are working together!

## What I expect from my team

I expect you to be honest and open with me. You can tell me everything and I will do all that I can to help. I want you
to treat our 1 on 1s seriously. Don’t cancel them unless you have to. Do the preparation and make sure you fulfill task we agree to.

It is important to me that we do things we commit to. If I don’t follow through on a commitment to you please let me
know. I will also let you know if you forget about something ;). 

I hope that you will feel challenged and learn new things. If you don’t please let me know! I don't expect you will
always be on a steep growth trajectory but you should aim to always think about pushing yourself.

I really like when you come to me. Even if you think it might be a bother, it’s really not. If you have any problems,
questions please don't hesitate to let me know. You can ask me anything and I really enjoy when you do. If you have any problem please don't assume I know that. Tell me so we can be on the same page.

## What you can expect from me
I will ask questions. A lot. Those questions will be challenging at times ... even uncomfortable, but I hope in a good way! I assume that you know what you are doing and I'm here to shine the light into the right
direction not to lead you by the hand. 

You can expect weekly 1 on 1 from me. During meetings, we will discuss your short and mid-term progress. From time to
time we will also discuss your long-term goals. Those meetings are important to me and I'll make sure they will happen.

I will ask you to make commitments for yourself. You can expect me to hold you accountable for those. I feel that you
know best what is good for you personally and professionally. If you say that you are going to do something I'll follow up.

I'm always here for you. I’m available any time in the office, on slack, email or video during work hours. Other times
I’ll be less available, but I will take your call if there’s something urgent.

I will try to build a strong relationship based on trust and understanding. It shouldn't be only about work, but about
people and true connection.

## My answers to first 1:1 questions
### How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?
Just give it to me. Whatever feels the most natural to you works for me. I want feedback so much that the media doesn't
matter that much. All feedback is welcomed.

### How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?
As it happens

### How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)
Public, I like Goalpost Recognition for sure :)

### What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?
I want to be a better manager. I want to achieve Senior level management ASAP. I also want to help my squad with daily
tasks and want to be more involved in the bigger picture.

### What do you need from your manager?
Trust that I can do my job well and challenges so I can improve. I want to know that I'm represented well in the company
and that my manager has my back.

### What do you need from your team?
I want them to be honest with me and to let me know about all their needs, problems and questions. Only then I can help
them. I also would like them to grow and challenge themselves. It will be great if they think about what is being said
and challenge me if something doesn't feel right.
